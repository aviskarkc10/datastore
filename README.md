**Note: Verida Datastore is in active development with an alpha release coming Q1 2020**

## Introduction

The Verida Datastore enables developers to quickly build self-sovereign applications &mdash; allowing users to own their own data. The system is **distributed** by design, enabling user data to be stored on Verida infrastructure, a user's own infrastructure or use third party hosting providers.

Verida Datastore provides an easy to use library that abstracts the complexities of **encryption, permissioning, schema management and user management**.

Applications can access user data once unlocked by a users blockchain wallet (ie: Ethereum, VeChain).

Applications can store unstructured data, but are encouraged to use the built-in data schemas pre-defined by Verida (or develop their own custom schemas). This ensures all applications built using Verida Datastore can interoperate together with data of a particular type created in one application available in all other applications that support that data type.

The Verida Datastore is the first component in a broader ecosystem of open source tools being developed by Verida.
